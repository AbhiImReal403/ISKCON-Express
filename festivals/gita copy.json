    "content": "Gita Jayanti is the auspicious day of the advent of Srimad Bhagavad-gita. This is the day on which Lord Krishna imparted the essence of Vedic knowledge to Arjuna over 5000 years ago and enlightened him about the ultimate goal of life. As stated in the Gita-mahatmya, if one properly follows the instructions of Bhagavad-gita, one can be freed from all miseries and anxieties in this life, and one’s next life will be spiritual. Bhagavad-gita literally means the song of the Supreme Lord. It is the most widely known Vedic literature in the world. This year we celebrated Gita Jayanti on December 03, 2022. The Bhagavad Gita is the essence of Vedic wisdom given by Lord Sri Krishna. His message holds the key to ending all of life’s misgivings and the secret to a life of happiness, satisfaction, fulfilment and self-discovery. Srila Prabhupada, the Founder-Acharya of ISKCON, has presented the Bhagavad Gita As It Is in a scholarly yet simple language. This is the best–selling version of the Gita in the world. Srila Prabhupada also emphasized distributing this matchless gift to everyone. ISKCON Bangalore has taken up the mission of extensively distributing the Bhagavad Gita at the temple and many locations in the country.",
